              <p class="lead text-justify"> 1. Create a security system: Unlike traditional administrative structures, where operations and rule enforcement are handled from the top down, building a security system with your human capital must be organized from the bottom up. This enterprise security system begins by securing the devices that your employees use in your business. Create an accountability culture in which everyone communicates when systems do not appear to be working as intended. .</p>

           
             
              <p class="lead text-justify"> 2. Increase your employee skillset: The strength of your cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest link. Train your team on the most recent IT best practices on a regular basis. Assist them in understanding that their efforts are critical to protecting company assets and that it is in their best interests to expand their IT knowledge base, whether they are a software developer or a marketing specialist. While it may be costly at first, investing in coding boot camps for your employees is a worthwhile investment.
           
              <p class="lead text-justify"> 3. Backup your data: You must constantly backup your organization's data, just as the best YouTubers do with the video footage they record. Always backup your critical data, files, and electronic information, as well as the most recent drafts/iterations of projects your team is working on.
             
              <p class="lead text-justify"> 4. Put the cloud to work: Although the cloud still has risks, saving data to the cloud reduces the likelihood of losing critical data. For small to medium-sized businesses, using the cloud for data storage is a cost-effective option. Cloud storage and cloud security tools can scale with smaller businesses as they scale and grow as a result of increased sales. Cloud options are constantly improving, ensuring that your company always has the most up-to-date storage and cyber security options.
             
             <p class="lead text-justify"> 5. Invest in your IT infrastructure: Install antivirus and firewall software on your computers. Firewalls will deter the average cybercriminal from causing harm to your company. Update your computer security systems on a regular basis. When it comes to investing in your IT infrastructure, don't be afraid.
